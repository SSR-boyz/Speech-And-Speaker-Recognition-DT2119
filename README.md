### Lab 1 - Feature extraction
- [X] Compute MFCC features step-by-step.
- [X] Examine features.
- [X] Evaluate correlation between feature.
- [X] Compare utterances with Dynamic Time Warping.
- [X] Illustrate the discriminative power of the features with respect to words.
- [X] Perform hierarchical clustering of utterances.
- [X] Train and analyze a Gaussian Mixture Model of the feature vectors.


### Lab 2 - Hidden Markov Models with Gaussian Emissions

- [ ] Deﬁne appropriate DNN models for phoneme recognition using Keras, 
- [ ] Train and evaluate the DNN models on a frame-by-frame recognition score, 
- [ ] Repeat the training by varying model parameters and input features Optional: 
- [ ] Perform and evaluate continuous speech recognition at the phoneme and word level using Gaussian-emission HMM models 
- [ ] Perform and evaluate continuous speech recognition at the phoneme and word level using DNN-HMM models
