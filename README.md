# Speech-And-Speaker-Recognition-DT2119

### Lab 1 - Feature extraction
- [ ] Compute MFCC features step-by-step.
- [ ] Examine features.
- [ ] Evaluate correlation between feature.
- [ ] Compare utterances with Dynamic Time Warping.
- [ ] Illustrate the discriminative power of the features with respect to words.
- [ ] Perform hierarchical clustering of utterances.
- [ ] Yrain and analyze a Gaussian Mixture Model of the feature vectors.


### Lab 2 - Hidden Markov Models with Gaussian Emissions
- [ ] Combine phonetic HMMs into word HMMs using a lexicon 
- [ ] Implement the forward-backward algorithm, 
- [ ] Use it compute the log likelihood of spoken utterances given a Gaussian HMM 
- [ ] Perform isolated word recognition 
- [ ] Implement the Viterbi algorithm, and use it to compute Viterbi path and likelihood 
- [ ] Compare and comment Viterbi and Forward likelihoods 
- [ ] ImplementtheBaum-Welch algorithm toupdatetheparametersoftheemissionprobability distributions
